# Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at Car Dheko, tasked with creating an accurate and user-friendly tool that predicts the prices of used cars. This tool should integrate seamlessly into an interactive web application for users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.

# Project Scope
The project utilizes historical data on used car prices from CarDekho, including features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from various cities. Your task is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting car prices based on these features.

# Approach
# 1. Data Processing
# Import and Concatenate:

Import multiple city datasets in unstructured format.
Convert these datasets into a structured format.
Add a new column named ‘City’ and assign respective values to all rows.
Concatenate all datasets into a single comprehensive dataset.
# Handling Missing Values:

Identify and fill or remove missing values.
Use mean, median, or mode imputation for numerical columns.
Use mode imputation or create a new category for missing values in categorical columns.
# Standardizing Data Formats:

Ensure all data types are correct.
For instance, remove units like "kms" from strings and convert to integer.
# Encoding Categorical Variables:

Convert categorical features to numerical values using one-hot encoding for nominal variables and label/ordinal encoding for ordinal variables.
# Normalizing Numerical Features:

Scale numerical features to a standard range (0 to 1) using techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling.
# Removing Outliers:

Identify and remove or cap outliers using methods such as the IQR (Interquartile Range) method or Z-score analysis.
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to understand data distribution.
# Data Visualization:

Create visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps) to identify patterns and correlations.
# Feature Selection:

Identify significant features impacting car prices through correlation analysis and feature importance.
# 3. Model Development
# Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets (common ratios: 70-30 or 80-20).
# Model Selection:

Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for price prediction:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
# Model Training:

Train selected models on the training dataset using cross-validation for robust performance.
# Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
# 4. Model Evaluation
# Performance Metrics:

# Evaluate model performance using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared
# Model Comparison:

Compare different models based on evaluation metrics to select the best-performing one.
# 5. Optimization
# Feature Engineering:

Create or modify features based on exploratory data analysis insights to enhance model performance.
# Regularization:

Apply regularization techniques (Lasso and Ridge) to prevent overfitting.
# 6. Deployment
# Streamlit Application:

Deploy the final model using Streamlit for an interactive web application.
Enable users to input car features and obtain real-time price predictions.
# User Interface Design:

Design an intuitive user interface with clear instructions and error handling.
# Results
A functional and accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices.
Comprehensive analysis and visualizations of the dataset.
Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, models, and results.
An interactive Streamlit application for real-time price predictions based on user input.
